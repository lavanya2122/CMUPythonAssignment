CMU Python assignment

Description

This is regarding the movie recommendations task as part of the summer preperation for MSSM FT program. I have completed the task by providing movie recommendations as per the specified requirements in the task.

The code helps in providing movie recommendations by first splitting the Movie Name column from the given file 1 and then capitalizing the first letter of each file in the input file. Then I created nested dictionaries in order to fetch data as per the age and movies recommended based on the ratings. Later the best recommended movies are displayed based on the hightest rating, in decreasing order Ex: rating 5 through rating 1. Also included a parameter which specifies maximum number of movies recommended. This gives the number of movies specified and the best rated movies. Here I have used age criteria to determine which movies are recommended as per the age. Later used the second inout file to include these recommendations to the new users given in the list.
